# Flow-Demo
Sample project exploring the use of Square's [Flow](https://github.com/square/flow).

I am particularly exploring how to use Flow when dealing with dynamic layouts, which Jake Wharton
has noted are problematic for Flow [here](https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/442907679854317568).

I was able to get it mostly working in this simple use-case, but it's not perfect. It could easily get out of hand in more complex projects.  Perhaps I will write a blog post about it later...
